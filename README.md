## Hi! I'm Anna 👋

Hi there! I'm a passionate **Software Developer** working in the **Computer Vision & Graphics** domain. My day-to-day involves solving visual problems with code — bringing images, data, and pixels to life 🖼️💡.

I have a curious mind and a deep love for **exploring diverse tech topics**, especially in the world of **Cyber Security 🔐**, where I enjoy understanding how systems break — and how to secure them.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me **riding horses 🐎** — it's my way of balancing the logic of machines with the freedom of nature.
